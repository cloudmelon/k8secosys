## About gRPC 

**gRPC** is an Open Source project that comes from Google. Google has been running a microservices architecture internally for over a decade. Google’s internal stack relies heavily on utilising RPCs (or Remote Procedure Calls). Every application is built using many RPC services that provide different tiers of functionality.

Historically, Google has used an internal system called “Stubby” as it’s RPC framework to help combat some of the issues we were looking at just previously. This gave Google a strong basis for RPC and Microservices within Google’s applications.

gRPC is the open sourcing and continued development of Stubby. This makes it available to the rest of the developer community, so you can take advantage of it for your own Microservices based applications.
